# React Router Catch-All Route Conflict

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using catch-all routes (`/*`) in React Router. The catch-all route, intended to handle any unmatched paths, can interfere with other route definitions if not properly positioned.

## The Problem

When a catch-all route is placed before other routes, it will capture all paths, preventing other routes from ever being matched.  This issue is exemplified in `App.js`, resulting in the `NotFound` component being rendered even when valid routes exist.

## The Solution

The solution is to move the catch-all route to the end of the `Routes` definition. This ensures that other routes have a chance to match before the catch-all route takes over.  This corrected code is shown in `AppSolution.js`.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the app: `npm start`
4. Observe the unexpected behavior in `App.js`.  Navigate to `/about` â€“ it should show `NotFound` instead of `About`.
5. Switch to `AppSolution.js` to see the corrected behavior.
